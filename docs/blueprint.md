## Style Guidelines:

- The overall feeling should be professional and trustworthy. The primary color, a saturated blue (#3498DB), conveys trust. This decision reflects the app needing to be seen as competent. It also has ties to the outbound.io visual style.
- A very light blue background (#EBF5FB) maintains a professional aesthetic without being too stark.
- For an accent color, choose a purple (#8E44AD). This adds a touch of sophistication and can highlight important action items, such as download buttons, or payment details.
- Use a clean, modern sans-serif font for body text to ensure readability. Font sizes should be adjustable for accessibility.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, inspired by outbound.io, with clear sections for input, output, and editing. Prioritize a mobile-first, responsive design.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading states and transitions to improve user experience without being distracting.
- Use a set of consistent, professional icons for navigation and key actions. Consider icons that are easily recognizable and universally understood in a professional context.
